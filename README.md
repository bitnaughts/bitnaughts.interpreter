To set up the development environment, see [bitnaughts.unity](https://github.com/bitnaughts/bitnaughts.unity).

BitNaughts is a retro sci-fi competitive programming MMO like no other. Instead of grinding levels to beat your opponents, the champion of the galaxy is who ever can write the most optimized, most effective, and most deadly code. 

BitNaughts is an educational yet competitive coding video game where players succeed off of the merit of their code. We believe video games are a great medium to teach the next generations anything from puzzle-solving skills to computer science concepts in a gamified environment.

# Coding Interpreter

Striving to have the maximum level of customization, BitNaughts allows players to customize the code of every aspect of their ships.

This serves as a gameplay tool (again, customizability) and an educational opportunity for those interested in or proficient in computer science. Of course, for those not interested in coding, the game is playable without having to write a single line in our interpreter, but over time, even those who might at first feel intimidated by coding will try it out.
